Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

#### Example 1:

Input: <br>
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] <br>

Output: <br>
4 <br>

Explanation: <br>
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
