Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

Input: n = 3<br>
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]<br>

Update:
The brute force approach will be costly in terms of time complexity. It is better to create such parentheses instead of finding them in the formed list of permutations.
